# XGBoost_SHAP
Use the XGBoost method to build regression models and SHAP for interpretation.
To optimize the model's performance, the hyperparameters are adjusted systematically.
GridSearchCV is employed to explore the optimal combination of these parameters, utilizing cross-validation to evaluate model performance across different parameter sets.
